> You've started a new movie-rating website, and you've been collecting data on reviewers' ratings of various movies. There's not much data yet, but you can still try out some interesting queries. Here's the schema: 

> Movie ( mID, title, year, director ) 
English: There is a movie with ID number mID, a title, a release year, and a director. 

> Reviewer ( rID, name ) 
English: The reviewer with ID number rID has a certain name. 

> Rating ( rID, mID, stars, ratingDate ) 
English: The reviewer rID gave the movie mID a number of stars rating (1-5) on a certain ratingDate. 

> Your queries will run over a small data set conforming to the schema. View the [database](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/c4x/DB/SQL/asset/moviedata.html). (You can also [download the schema and data](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod-c2g/db/Winter2013/files/rating.sql).)
